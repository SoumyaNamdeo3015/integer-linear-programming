## About the algorithm : (gomory's cutting plane algorithm )

refer to this link : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting-plane_method#:~:text=dominates%20Gomory%20cuts.-,Gomory's%20cut,while%20respecting%20the%20linear%20constraints.

## About input_ilp.txt :

The first two lines of input file contains the type of linear programming problem i.e maximizing or minimizing of the objective function.
Then it contains matirx A , followed by matrix b .
Then we have our constraint types which include >= , <= and = only.
at last matrix c (cost vector) is entered.
note:the input file name must be input_ilp.txt
note:matrices A,b,c have integral entries
